	Put your loving hand out, baby<br>
'Cause I'm beggin'<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, darling<br>
Riding high, when I was king<br>
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything<br>
I walked away, but you warned me then<br>
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end<br>
So, any time I bleed, you let me go<br>
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know<br>
Any time I seek, you let me know<br>
But I plan and see, just let me go<br>
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'<br>
'Cause I don't want to lose you<br>
Hey yeah, ratatata<br>
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
And put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
And put your loving hand out, darling<br>
I need you to understand<br>
Tried so hard to be your man<br>
The kind of man you want in the end<br>
Only then can I begin to live again<br>
An empty shell<br>
I used to be<br>
The shadow of my life was hanging over me<br>
A broken man<br>
That I don't know<br>
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul<br>
What we doing? What we chasing?<br>
Why the bottom? Why the basement?<br>
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?<br>
Why the feel for the need to replace me?<br>
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture telling where we could be at<br>
Like a heart ain't attached the way it should<br>
You can give it away, you had, and you took the pay<br>
But I keep walking on<br>
Keep opening doors<br>
Keep hoping for<br>
That the call is yours<br>
Keep calls on hold<br>
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home<br>
Girl, I'm begging<br>
Mmm, ye-e-e-ah<br>
I'm beggin', begin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, darling<br>
I'm fighting hard<br>
To hold my own<br>
Just can't make it all alone<br>
I'm holding on<br>
I can't fall back<br>
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
Put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, darling<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, darling<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out, baby<br>
I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
So, put your loving hand out<br>
